# Chatbot 

This project is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-powered chatbot built using Python and the `nltk` library. Developed as part of my **CodeAlpha Python Internship**, this chatbot can recognize user intent from text input and respond accordingly using keyword matching and tokenization.

---

##  Features
- Text-based chatbot interface
- Intent recognition using `nltk`
- Predefined responses based on common intents (greetings, farewells, etc.)
- Easily extendable with more intents and NLP features
- Randomized responses for a more human-like feel

---

##  How It Works
- Uses `nltk` to tokenize user input
- Maps input to predefined intents based on keywords
- Picks a random response for each intent category

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**: 
  - [`nltk`](https://www.nltk.org/) â€“ Natural Language Toolkit for basic NLP tasks
