# CodeAlpha_Chatbot

This is a simple, text-based chatbot built as part of my internship with **CodeAlpha**. The bot simulates basic conversations by recognizing keywords and responding accordingly. It demonstrates core logic building in Python and can be easily extended using Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like `nltk` or `spaCy`.

##  Features
- Handles basic greetings and questions
- Recognizes exit command
- Simple rule-based response system
- Easy to customize and expand

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Standard Libraries: `input()`, `print()`, basic conditionals

##  How to Run
```bash
python chatbot.py
